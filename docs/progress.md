# Tiny Crawl - Progress Tracking

## Purpose

This document tracks the implementation progress of Tiny Crawl development. Completed phases and steps will be appended here with completion dates and relevant notes.

## Completed Phases

_No phases have been completed yet._

## Completed Steps

### Phase 0: Project Setup
- Step 0.1: Initialize Project Structure - Completed on [Current Date]
  - Created Vite project with TypeScript configuration
  - Set up ESLint, Prettier, and Jest
  - Configured project structure with basic filesect Setup
- Step 0.1: Initialize Project Structure
## Current Work with Vite and TypeScript

Currently working on Phase 0: Project Setup
- Step 0.2: Install Dependencies
- Need to ensure all packages are correctly configurede project setup. Will be setting up the development environment with Vite, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and Jest. Then we'll install Phaser 3 and set up the basic game structure.

## Implementation Notes

- Project structure follows the architecture outlined in the documentation
- Basic scene system is in place with placeholders for future implementation
- Game is configured at 60x40 pixel resolution with 500% scaling

## Testing Statuss yet._

- Initial project structure builds without errors
- Basic scene transitions work correctly
- No gameplay functionality tests yetwith Vite and TypeScript
2. Configure ESLint, Prettier, and Jest
## Known Issuesaser 3 and other dependencies
4. Set up initial game structure
_No known issues yet._
## Next Steps

1. Complete Step 0.2: Verify all dependencies are correctly installed
2. Proceed to Step 0.3: Configure Development Environment
3. Implement scaling system and test rendering
