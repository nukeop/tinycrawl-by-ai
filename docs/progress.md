# Tiny Crawl - Progress Tracking

## Purpose

This document tracks the implementation progress of Tiny Crawl development. Completed phases and steps will be appended here with completion dates and relevant notes.

## Completed Phases

_No phases have been completed yet._

## Completed Steps

### Phase 0: Project Setup

- Step 0.1: Initialize Project Structure - Completed
  - Created Vite project with TypeScript configuration
  - Set up ESLint, Prettier, and Jest
  - Configured project structure with basic files
- Step 0.2: Install Dependencies - Completed
  - Installed Phaser and other dependencies
  - Created utility files and constants
- Step 0.3: Configure Development Environment - Completed
  - Set up Vite dev server with hot reloading
  - Configured Jest for unit testing
  - Created initial HTML structure
- Step 0.4: Create Base Project Files - Completed
  - Implemented main entry point
  - Created entity system
  - Implemented combat system
  - Set up player controller
  - Created inventory system
- Step 0.5: Implement Scaling System - Completed
  - Created rendering canvas at 60x40 pixels
  - Implemented integer scaling (500%)
  - Configured pixel-perfect rendering
  - Added scaling test scene to verify rendering quality
  - Created placeholder sprites for testing
- Step 0.6: Configure for Web Embedding - Completed
  - Created EmbedAPI for iframe communication
  - Implemented responsive container adaptation
  - Added URL parameter support for embedding options
  - Created an embed demo page for testing
  - Set up cross-origin communication with postMessage

## Phase 1: Core Game Engine

- Step 1.1: Create Basic Scene System - Completed
  - Created BaseScene class for common functionality
  - Implemented improved scene transitions with fade effects
  - Added pause/resume functionality
  - Standardized scene initialization and cleanup
  - Updated all scenes to extend from BaseScene

## Current Work

Currently working on Phase 1: Core Game Engine

- Step 1.2: Implement Asset Management
  - Planning to enhance asset loading system
  - Will create a sprite sheet management system
  - Need to implement texture management

## Implementation Notes

- Implemented entity system with base Entity class and Player/Enemy extensions
- Created combat system with turn-based mechanics
- Implemented inventory system for item management
- Set up basic scene transitions between exploration and combat
- Added player movement with keyboard and mouse controls
- Created placeholder sprites with Phaser's graphics objects
- Added PixelScaleHelper to ensure rendering consistency
- Created a test scene to verify pixel-perfect scaling
- Created an embed API with two-way communication for controlling the game
- Implemented responsive scaling for different container sizes
- Added URL parameter support for customizing embedded instances
- Created a demo page showing how to embed and control the game
- Created a BaseScene class that all scenes extend from
- Implemented fade transitions between scenes
- Added a pause/resume system with overlay UI
- Added escape key handling for game pausing
- Standardized scene initialization with helpers

## Testing Status

- Project structure builds without errors
- Basic scene transitions work correctly
- Combat system logic works as expected
- Unit tests for debug utility are passing
- Pixel scaling tests confirm proper rendering
- Scene transitions now have smooth fade effects
- Pause functionality works correctly with escape key
- Scene system is more maintainable with shared code in BaseScene

## Known Issues

- Only placeholder graphics instead of actual sprites
- Combat system needs more testing

## Next Steps

1. Complete Step 1.2: Implement Asset Management
2. Proceed to Step 1.3: Setup Input System
3. Continue with remaining steps in Phase 1
