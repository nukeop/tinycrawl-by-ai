# Tiny Crawl - Progress Tracking

## Purpose

This document tracks the implementation progress of Tiny Crawl development. Completed phases and steps will be appended here with completion dates and relevant notes.

## Completed Phases

_No phases have been completed yet._

## Completed Steps

### Phase 0: Project Setup

- Step 0.1: Initialize Project Structure - Completed
  - Created Vite project with TypeScript configuration
  - Set up ESLint, Prettier, and Jest
  - Configured project structure with basic files
- Step 0.2: Install Dependencies - Completed
  - Installed Phaser and other dependencies
  - Created utility files and constants
- Step 0.3: Configure Development Environment - Completed
  - Set up Vite dev server with hot reloading
  - Configured Jest for unit testing
  - Created initial HTML structure
- Step 0.4: Create Base Project Files - Completed
  - Implemented main entry point
  - Created entity system
  - Implemented combat system
  - Set up player controller
  - Created inventory system

## Current Work

Currently working on Phase 0: Project Setup

- Step 0.5: Implement Scaling System
  - Set up rendering canvas at 60x40 pixels
  - Ensure pixel-perfect rendering
  - Test rendering with sample graphics

## Implementation Notes

- Implemented entity system with base Entity class and Player/Enemy extensions
- Created combat system with turn-based mechanics
- Implemented inventory system for item management
- Set up basic scene transitions between exploration and combat
- Added player movement with keyboard and mouse controls
- Included placeholder graphics for testing

## Testing Status

- Project structure builds without errors
- Basic scene transitions work correctly
- Combat system logic works as expected
- Unit tests for debug utility are passing

## Known Issues

- Placeholder graphics instead of actual sprites
- No asset loading system yet
- Combat system needs more testing
- Type issues need to be fixed in InventorySystem

## Next Steps

1. Complete Step 0.5: Implement Scaling System
2. Add an Asset system to load placeholder player/enemy sprites
3. Fix type issues in InventorySystem - replace 'any' with proper types
4. Proceed to Step 0.6: Configure for Web Embedding
